Designed for easy integration and configuration across multiple maps and assets, **Interactive mining mechanics** with hit detection and rock health tracking, **VFX feedback** (dust and shake effects) on impact, **Respawn logic** for destructible rocks (configurable 5–10 second delay), **Damage scaling** based on pickaxe quality and upgrade level: all delivered as a clean, efficient module with reusable configuration options for future expansion.",
