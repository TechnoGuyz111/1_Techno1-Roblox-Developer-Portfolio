			"desc_markdown": "Initially began as **Fisherman’s Dream**, a classic **fishing simulator**, but pivoted mid-development into a **'brainrot-style' game** inspired by the currently trending Roblox genre. Contributed as **Scripter and UI Designer**, completing multiple gameplay and interface systems - from completing custom animations, plot management, fishing, and DataStore-saved placement systems, to in-game UIs ranging from player HUDs, Indexes, and Shops (to name a few). The project represents a fast-paced creative adaptation — transforming a relaxing simulator into a hyperactive experience aligned with current Roblox trends.",
